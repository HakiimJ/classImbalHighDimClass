Classification of Large Number Variable with Two Imbalanced Groups.
This project contains some codes to run classification algorithms to cater high-dimensional imbalanced binary group objects.
Three main methods are employed i.e. linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification; principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction; and random under and over sampling (RUS or ROS) for group balancing.
